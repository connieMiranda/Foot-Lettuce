Question 7:
Time to run: 7.912120 s
CPU: 91.4%, RAM: 71.4%

Time to run when niced: 12.344324 s
CPU: 78.5%, RAM: 70.9%

These are expected results, since running MATLAB when niced at -15 puts it at a
a low computation prority, it will take longer for the computations to be done.

Question 8:
MATLAB executable file is located at:
/usr/local/MATLAB/R2017b/bin/matlab
This path can be executed just by typing "matlab", because a symbolic link was created,
so that typing "matlab" would execute this path.
